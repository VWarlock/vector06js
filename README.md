vector06js Vector-06c Emulator in JavaScript

This is an original emulator of Vector-06c. It is written in JavaScript by hand, it is not a conversion or recompilation of any of previously existing emulators. Presently (2016) it is the only known free/open source software emulator of Vector-06c. It should work fine in Chrome and Firefox on any half decent PC.

Standalone version can take rom, r0m, bin, fdd files drag-n-dropped onto itself: http://asdasd.rpg.fi/scalar/vector06js

This emulator is integrated into the Vector06c software archive: http://asdasd.rpg.fi/scalar

It also works as a sandbox execution environment for the Pretty i8080 Assembler: http://asdasd.rpg.fi/~svo/i8080/ Try pressing RUN.
