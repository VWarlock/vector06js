vector06js Vector-06c Emulator in JavaScript

This emulator should work fine in Chrome and Firefox. 

Standalone version can take some files drag-n-dropped onto itself.

This emulator is integrated into the software archive: http://asdasd.rpg.fi/scalar

It also works as a testbed in the Pretty i8080 Assembler: http://asdasd.rpg.fi/~svo/i8080/ (try pressing RUN)
